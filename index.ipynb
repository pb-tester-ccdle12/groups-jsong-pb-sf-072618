    "### Mathematical Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike fields, groups have only a single operation. In our case, Point Addition is our operation. We also have a few other properties like closure, invertibility, commutativity and associativity. Lastly, we need the identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that we have all of these things with Point Addition. Let's look at each property:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't guessed by now, the identity is defined as the point at infinity. This is the point, when added to any other point produces the other point. So:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 + P = P\n",
    "\n",
    "We call 0 the point at infinity because visually, it's the point that exists to help the math work out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Closure\n",
    "\n",
    "This is perhaps the easiest to prove since we generated the group in the first place by adding G over and over. Thus, two different elements look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`aG + bG`\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the result is going to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(a+b)G`\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know if this element is in the group? If a+b < n, then we know it's in the group by definition. If a+b >= n, then we know a < n and b < n, so a+b<2n so a+b-n<n.\n",
    "\n",
    "`(a+b-n)G=aG+bG-nG=aG+bG-O=aG+bG`\n",
    "\n",
    "So we know that this element is in the group, proving closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Invertibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we know that if aG is in the group, `(n-a)G` is also in the group. You can add them together to get 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commutativity\n",
    "\n",
    "P+Q=Q+P because they end up drawing the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations for figuring out the third point also make this clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\(P_{1} = (x_{1}, y_{1}), P_{2} = (x_{2}, y_{2}), P_{3} = (x_{3}, y_{3}) \\\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\(x_{3} = s^2 - x_{1} - x_{2}\\\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\(y_{3} = s(x_{1}-x_{3}) - y_{1} = s(x_{2}-x_{3}) - y_{2}\\\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can swap \\\\(P_{1}\\\\) and \\\\(P_{2}\\\\) to get the exact same equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Associativity\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the hardest to prove but we'll dive deeper into it later."
